Context
This version of the dataset is an update of the original, available at:
Kaggle – Sports Classification Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/sports-classification/data

The original dataset contains images collected from internet searches, covering 100 distinct sports categories. A duplicate detection program was applied to remove identical or near-identical images, avoiding bias in the model evaluation process. All images were resized to 224×224×3 (RGB) and converted to .jpg format. A .csv file is included, specifying the relative path of each image, its class label, and its corresponding dataset split (train, validation, or test).

Filtering and Dataset Structure
For the purposes of this study, a targeted selection of 10 sports classes was performed, based on criteria of representativeness and diversity of physical movement. This filtering resulted in the creation of a new compressed archive (.zip), containing only the samples corresponding to the selected 10 classes.

During the extraction process, the original folder structure of the dataset was preserved, with the following standardized distribution:

Training: 1,205 images

Validation: 259 images

Testing: 263 images

Total: 1,727 images

All images were kept in RGB format with a resolution of 224×224 pixels, ensuring compatibility with convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures widely used in the literature, such as VGG, ResNet, and EfficientNet.

Conclusion
Despite the reduced number of classes and samples, the filtered dataset is well-suited for validation of neural network architectures, application of data augmentation techniques, and overfitting analysis. However, the limited number of samples presents a high risk of overfitting, requiring the use of regularization methods and/or effective data augmentation strategies to ensure model generalization.
